# Car Geo-Logger Board

**September 2022:** First v1 board designed with a horizantal mounted USB-C connector and 0603 (imperial) sized passives. Currently waiting for assembly and testing. The v1 board is a experimental prototype, some expected patch notes for next version, 

- Pure SMD components, standardize to 0603 (imperial)
- Vertical mounted USB-C connector
- SD-Card socket erratically had a layer for milling on Altium, change library and part
- Less beefier backup battery, change library and battery (current LR44).

The ideal board is a minimal ESP32 module embedded with a USB to UART bridge, GPS chip, and SD storage.
